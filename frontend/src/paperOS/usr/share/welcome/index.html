        <h1>welcome to paperOS! V.0.2!</h1>
        <p>paperOS is built ENTIRELY on POK (PaperOS Kernel, initially POSH3). This combines the power of POSH2, and put's it all on the web.<br>
        <h2>What is new?</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Upgraded file system!<h3>
                
        <p>We are now using a cache system, so you can store even <i>more</i> files then you could previously</p>
        If you would like to create an app, feel free to check out and modify <i>YOUR</i> copy of POSH. AKA the  PaperOsSHell! </p>
        
        <h3>2. Added network proxy system</h3>
